I’ve come across a number of weblogs made by people who talk about things I find interesting. There are times I find myself going back to read them again because of how meaningful they are to me, even if they think it’s small or insignificant.

But from the writer’s perspective, I think I understand that it’s tough to get your first two sentences down. Perhaps some of us had been thinking about starting to write more often but we hesitate whether or not we should put it on the web. Partly because we’re afraid how much truth our words would hold. And I think it’s okay to feel that way, since we’re simply human who can easily make mistakes at times when we’re unaware of it the most.

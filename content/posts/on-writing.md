For decades, books have been a friend to humans. If we connect the strings we will probably see that almost every great civilization has a tight relationship with books (i.e., knowledge). And this is a trivial thing, but one way to share knowledge is by writing precious books that eventually last for generations. It's probably heard that people in ancient times (take early Islamic scholars in the Middle East or famous mathematicians in ancient Greece as a few examples), used to use this method (and we still do). People benefit a lot from taking insights from one another, as there is a good chance that one person might not know about something until someone else brings it up to the table.

The Internet made it even easier for us to do this thought-sharing process. _Well, it's trivial_, we might say.

But the fact that we think it's trivial probably explains why we take it so much for granted.

There’s massive amounts of written knowledge all over the Internet. Of course a good portion of them are objectively true and another good portion aren't. But the point is that it shows how much potential it can have, and consequently, just how much potential would be of waste if we don't use it to its fullest potential. Maybe you've got a little piece of insight after reflecting some of your things that have been going on in your life (or that math class you just took last week), or a good piece of advice. On top of it, you know it's the right thing. Why not share it to the web?

I’ve seen a number of weblogs and personal articles made by people who talk about things that I find interesting. Even if they think it's small or insignificant.

To know that there are a lot of people with their own unique personalities and perspectives brings me some kind of joy.

But from the perspective of a writer, I think understand a little how tough it is to get your first sentences on paper. I'd been thinking about starting a blog, but had been putting it off since, because I was afraid how much truth my words would hold, since I'm simply human who can easily make mistakes at times when I’m unaware of it the most.

That's part of the reason why I wrote this, so hopefully I can just start and learn as I go. And hopefully you can too.

Have a good day.
